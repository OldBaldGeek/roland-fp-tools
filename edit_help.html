<H2>The Meanings of the Edit Fields and Registration Lines</H2>

<P>In this section, we describe each field in the Registration 
editor, and each line of a Registration, showing where it comes from if
you create the Registration on the piano, and some information about
the range and purpose of the setting.</P>

<P>You can get more information about most of these items in the
&ldquo;Various Settings (Function Mode)&rdquo; section of the Owner's Manual
for your piano,
<a href="https://www.roland.com/global/support/owners_manuals/" target="_blank">
available on the Roland website.</a></P>

<h3 id="registrationPedalShift">Registration Pedal Shift</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;registrationPedalShift&quot;: 0,</P>

<P CLASS="indent">This is the value of &ldquo;Reg. Pedal Shift&rdquo;,
(Function 23 on the FP-90)
when the file is exported.  0 = off, 1 = left pedal, 2 = center pedal.
This item is at the top of the Registration file, and affects all Registrations.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">If the value is not "off", pressing the specified pedal will
advance to the next Registration.  In this case, the specified pedal
cannot be used for any of the other pedal functions.</P>


<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;name&quot;: &quot;ConcertPiano&quot;,</P>

<P CLASS="indent">Specifies a name for the Registration.
As entered when the Registration is saved.  Twelve or fewer characters
from the following set: A through Z; a through z; 0 through 9;
the symbols ! ? &amp; $ \ # @ + - * / % = . , ' &quot; : ; ( ) [ ] {
} &lt; &gt; ^ _ ` ~ and space.  The ampersand (&amp;) is rather odd
looking on the piano's LCD.  If you specify more than twelve
characters, only the first twelve will be shown.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">Shown
on the LCD when the Registration is selected.



<h3 id="comment">Notes</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;comment&quot;: "Hi Mom",</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Notes, or a description of the Registration and its features.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">This field is 
not a standard part of the UPG file.  It was added to our editor to aid in
understanding the capabilities of Registrations.  <b>Notes/comments</b> fields in a Registration
file will be ignored by the piano.  A Registration file exported by the piano
will not contain any <b>Notes/comments</b> fields.</P>


<h3 id="singleTone">Tone (Main/Upper Tone)</h3>
<P CLASS="indent">Specifies the main Tone to be used for the Registration.
If &ldquo;Split&rdquo; mode is active, then this is &ldquo;Right
Tone&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;Dual&rdquo; mode is active, this is &ldquo;Tone
1&rdquo;.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">
The editor shows a drop-list, from which you can select a Tone by Name.  The Registration
file specifies the Tone by its MIDI components, Bank and Program.  The editor
converts between the formats.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">You can <a href="tones.html">read more about Tones</a>, 
or look up the bank and program numbers in the  
&ldquo;MIDI Implementation Manual&rdquo; for your piano, available in
<a href="https://www.roland.com/global/support/owners_manuals/" target="_blank">
the Owner's Manual secction of the Roland website.</a></P>

<P class="regtext">&quot;singleToneMSB&quot;: 0,<BR>
&quot;singleToneLSB&quot;: 68,<BR>
&quot;singleTonePC&quot;: 0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Bank
and Program Number of the current Tone when the Registration is
saved.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">
Because of the way MIDI defines program numbers, the number you enter
for <B>singleTonePC</B> must be one less than the value shown in the
&ldquo;PC&rdquo; column of the Tone List.  Thus, &ldquo;Concert
Piano&rdquo; is shown in the document as MSB = 0, LSB = 68, PC = 1. 
It appears in the UPG file as 0, 68, 0 (see above).</P>

<P CLASS="indent">When
a Registration is selected, these values are transmitted on the MIDI
channel specified by <B><a href="#midiTxCh">midiTxCh</a></B> as CC 0, CC 12, and PC.</P>


<h3 id="upperVolume">Volume (Main/Upper Tone)</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;upperVolume&quot;:
100,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Setting
of the &ldquo;Upper&rdquo; Part fader when the Registration is saved.
 0 to 100.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">Note
that when you select a Registration, this value overrides the
position of the Upper Part fader and sets the volume of the part.  If
you subsequently move the fader, the new fader value will be used.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">When
a Registration is selected, transmits MIDI CC7 on the channel
specified by <B><a href="#midiTxCh">midiTxCh</a></B>.</P>


<h3 id="ambience">Ambience Type (FP-60X and FP-90X)</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;ambienceType&quot;: 2,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value of Ambience Type when the Registration is saved.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">This item is present on the FP-60X and FP-90X, but not on the FP-60 or FP-90</P>


<h3 id="ambience">Ambience (Ambience Depth on the FP-60X and FP-90X)</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;ambience&quot;: 2,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value of Ambience or Ambience Depth when the Registration is
saved. 0 (none) to 10 (large space).</P>

<P CLASS="indent">When
a Registration is selected, a value based on <B>ambience</B> is
transmitted using CC 91 (Effect 1 Depth) on MIDI channels <B><a href="#midiTxCh">midiTxCh</a></B>,
3, and 6.  The MIDI value is scaled so that an <B>ambience</B> value of 10
transmits a MIDI CC value of 127.</P>


<h3 id="modulationSpeed">Effect Level</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;modulationSpeed&quot;:
0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Range
0 to 100.  The effect of this value differs for different Tones.  For
example:</P>
<UL STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in;">
  <LI>Tremolo on some Electric Pianos
  <LI>Detune/chorus on some Electric Pianos
  <LI>Wah-wah speed on the Clavinet
</UL>

<P CLASS="indent">
For a complete list, see the "Modulation Amount" and "Modulation Effect" columns
in <a href="tones.html">more about Tones</a>.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">You can change this value on the piano by holding the current Tone button
(Piano, Electric Piano, etc.), and pressing the metronome slow and
fast buttons.  The adjusted value is shown on the LCD.  You can use
this to determine whether or not a given Tone allows a modulation
effect: if it doesn't, pressing the buttons won't show a modulation
value.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">Rather
oddly given the name, <B>modulationSpeed</B> <I>is not</I> affected
by MIDI CC1 (modulation).  Instead, you can change it by sending
MIDI CC12 (Effect 1) to the piano.  However, received CC12 affects
<I>all</I> channels, which seems to be a bug, or at least undesirable on a
multi-timbral instrument like this one.</P>


<h3 id="rotarySpeed">Rotary Effect</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;rotarySpeed&quot;: 0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">0
(off) or 1 (on).  This sets the initial value of the rotary speaker
effect on or off.  It operates only on certain of the electronic Organ
voices.  For a complete list, See the "Rotary Effect" column in
<a href="tones.html">more about Tones</a>.
The speed seems to be fixed (except for the ramp-up when you engage the effect,
and ramp-down when you disengate it), so the name isn't really accurate.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">When a Registration is selected that allows this effect,
transmits a value of 0 or 127 on MIDI CC12.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">If
you have one of the electronic organ Tones selected, you can toggle
this value by pressing &ldquo;Organ&rdquo; again.  But the
button toggle doesn't work in Registration mode.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">If
the center or left pedal is assigned to pedal function 10 (&quot;Rotary&quot;),
you can toggle the effect on and off with the pedal, using this
Registration setting to set the initial value.</P>


<h3 id="keyTouch">Key Touch</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;keyTouch&quot;:
50,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value of &ldquo;Key Touch&rdquo; (Function 1 on the FP-90)
when the Registration is saved. 0 (fixed) to 100.</P>


<h3 id="keyTranspose">Key Transpose</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;keyTranspose&quot;:
0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value
of Transpose, &ldquo;Kbd Transpose&rdquo;, when the Registration is saved. -6 to +5.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">This setting also transposes MIDI note messages sent by the keyboard.</P>


<h3 id="keyTransposeSw">Key Transpose Switch (FP-60X and FP-90X)</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;keyTransposeSw&quot;:
0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value
of Transpose on/off, &ldquo;Kbd Transpose&rdquo;, when the Registration is saved. 0 or 1.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">This item is present on the FP-60X and FP-90X, but not on the FP-60 or FP-90.
It enables or disables Transpose without changing the value of &quot;keyTranspose&quot;
</P>


<h3 id="songTranspose">Song Transpose</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;songTranspose&quot;:
0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value
of Transpose, &ldquo;Song Transpose&rdquo; when the Registration is
saved. -12 to +12.</P>


<h3 id="keyboardMode">Initial Keyboard Mode</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;keyboardMode&quot;:
0,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Value
of Single/Split/Dual mode when the Registration is saved. 0 = single,
1 = split, 2 = dual.</P>


<h3 id="lowerVolume">Lower/Second Volume</h3>
<P class="regtext">&quot;lowerVolume&quot;: 100,</P>
<P CLASS="indent">Setting
of the &ldquo;Lower&rdquo; Part fader when the Registration is saved.  0 to 100.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">Note
that when you select a Registration, this value overrides the
position of the Lower Part fader and sets the volume of the part.  If
you subsequently move the fader, the new fader value will be used.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">When
a Registration is selected, transmits MIDI CC7 on channel 3 and 6.</P>


<h3 id="splitLowerTone">Lower Tone (Split)</h3>
<P CLASS="indent">The editor
shows a drop-list, from which you can select a Tone by Name.  The Registration
file specifies the Tone by its MIDI components, Bank and Program.  The editor
converts between the formats.</P>

<P CLASS="indent">You can <a href="tones.html">read more about Tones</a>,
